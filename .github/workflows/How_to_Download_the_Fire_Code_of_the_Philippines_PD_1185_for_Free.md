Aside from downloading the Fire Code of the Philippines, it is also important to be aware of the common fire hazards that can cause fire incidents in the country. According to the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), the top cause of fires in the Philippines is faulty electrical connections or electrical overloading, which accounts for more than half of the fire cases in Metro Manila. This can be prevented by using quality wires and cables, installing them properly, avoiding overloading outlets and extension cords, and maintaining them regularly.
 
Other common fire hazards include unattended cooking or candles, cigarette butts, flammable chemicals, and natural disasters. To avoid these hazards, one should always monitor any open flame or heat source, dispose of cigarette butts properly, store flammable liquids safely, and prepare for emergencies such as typhoons, floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. The Philippines is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, where it is exposed to various natural hazards that can trigger or worsen fire incidents.
 
The BFP also advises the public to follow these fire safety tips: have a fire extinguisher and smoke detector at home or in the workplace, plan an escape route and practice fire drills regularly, keep combustible materials away from heat sources, turn off appliances when not in use, and report any signs of fire or smoke immediately. In case of fire, remember to stop, drop, and roll if your clothes catch fire; crawl low under smoke; and call for help.
 
By being informed and vigilant, we can prevent fires and protect ourselves and our properties from their devastating effects. Let us all do our part in promoting fire safety and prevention in our communities.
